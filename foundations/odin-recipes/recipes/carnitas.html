    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Flavorful, delicious, and sure not to disapoint. Plus, these carnitas are cooked in an instant pot, so they come out much faster than other methods!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4-5 lb) boneless pork shoulder, quartered with excess fat trimmed off</li>
        <li>1 cup (dark) beer</li>
        <li>6 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh orange juice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lime juice</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 chipotle pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 white onion, quartered</li>
        <li>For serving: cilantro, red onion, chipotle mayo, cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, mix beer, garlic, orange juice, lime juice, cumin, oregano, salt, pepper, and chipotle pepper until combined, set aside.</li>
        <li>Season pork chunks on all sides with salt, pepper, and chili powder.</li>
        <li>Turn the instant pot on to "Saute" mode. Add oil and half the pork. Sear on each side for about a minute or until golden brown. Remove and set aside, repeat with other half of pork. Finally, with the instant pot empty, add onion and saute for about 3 minutes, adding oil if needed. Add in sauce prepared earlier and scrape the bottom of the pot to clean it off. Press "Cancel" to turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Add pork back into the pot, trying to get each piece as submerged in the sauce as possible. Close lid and ensure vent is sealed.</li>
        <li>Cook on high pressure for 90 minutes then release the pressure.</li>
        <li>Open the instant pot, then use two forks to shred the pork. At this point, the chipotle pepper can be removed if found and discarded.</li>
        <li>Add a touch of olive oil to a frying pan and let it preheat some on medium-high.</li>
        <li>Cook pork in batches, adding in some of the remaining liquid whenever the pork dries out.</li>
        <li>Assemble tacos and serve!</li>
    </ol>
